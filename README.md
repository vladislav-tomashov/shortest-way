I heard a task from AWS. The task is following:
There is a known set of all English words consisting of 4 letters.
What is minimal transformations number from "POOL" to "SEAL".
A transformation is defined as one letter change in the word that produces another word from the set.

This code contains my implementation of this task in TypeScript.
